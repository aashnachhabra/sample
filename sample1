this is a worflow i create some time back to get changed files in a pr, but now it seems to be not working what previously it was working
this is the error
{
    "message": "Not Found",
    "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests-files",
    "status": "404"
}
please fix or suggest alternate ways to do this functionality
