June works for a privately owned company that's bidding on a government contract in Switzerland. As part of the process, June must interact with various people.

First, she meets with Silvan, her company's Vice President of Sales. Silvan is originally from Switzerland; he's well-versed in Swiss culture, so the team is leveraging his knowledge for their bid.

Then June spoke with Heilwig, an elected government representative from Geneva, who is the team's main point of contact for any bid-related questions.

Who is a public officialâ€”Silvan or Heilwig?
