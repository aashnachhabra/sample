I have an excel sheet which has columns and it has multiple entries
chatHistoryID	frontendStartTime	backendStartTime	agentResponseTime	agent reponse time (sec)	total response time	backendEndTime	request	response	status	Pass	Fail	createUserID			

I need to write a python codw which reads this excely and makes an api post call to http://localhost:8080/deepeval/geval and reqest body in this format
{
        "question": "Where is Paris",
        "llm_genrated_ans": "Europe",
        "ground_ans": "France"
    }

for question we need to pick column "request" for llm_genrated_ans and also ground_ans column response should be picked. 
The response from api call would be in this format
 {
        "reason": "The Actual Output 'Europe' does not match the Expected Output 'France', which is a major error in coverage status.",
        "score": 0.0
    }

add a column in the excel named "Deepeval test"
if score is >= 0.7 then put Deepeval test cell for that entry to be "Passed" otherwise put "Failed"
Please write the code in python
