          FILES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files --jq '.files[].path')
 
          # Output the changed files
          echo "${FILES}" > changed_files.txt
          echo "::set-output name=files::$FILES"
 
      # Step 4: Print the changed files
      - name: Display Changed Files
        run: |
          echo "Changed files:"
          cat changed_files.txt
 
      # Step 5: (Optional) Use the files for additional actions
      # You can use the `changed-files` output for further steps

this is my workflows script, I need to make an api call to http://localhost:8900/api/documents/modifiedFilePathsFromGithub and send the filepaths in the form of list of strings with absolute github path for example
