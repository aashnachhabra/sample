i have this prompt for my chatbot becca
elif CommonUtils.get_app_name() == CommonConstants.BECCA:
    return """
            Evaluate ACTUAL_OUTPUT against EXPECTED_OUTPUT for correctness and completeness.
    
            Scoring guidance:
            - 1.0 (100%): The answer matches the expected response in meaning and includes all key facts/values.
            - 0.75 (75%): Mostly correct but missing minor details, slight formatting differences are okay.
            - 0.5 (50%): Partially correct; includes some relevant info but misses key facts or contains ambiguity.
            - 0.0 (0%): Incorrect, irrelevant, hallucinated, or contradicts the expected response.
    
            Rules:
            - Do not penalize minor wording/format differences if meaning is the same.
            - Penalize hallucinated facts not supported by EXPECTED_OUTPUT.
            - If ACTUAL_OUTPUT is empty/"none"/error/refusal, score 0.0.
            """

so this chatbot is picking values from mongo so value matching is very important eg excel
